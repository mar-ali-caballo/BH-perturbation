This repository includes a completed python implementation of Asaad et al 's method to compute qnms of kerr spacetime. 
The fundamental mode can be easily retrieved to a float point accuracy and the subsequent modes can be too (depending on the rotation of the black hole, the amount of subsequent modes will vary).
Filtering is applied to the spectrum to make sure numerical noise can be minimised.
Future work will focus on implementation of mp.math for improved numerical accuracy and improved filtering. 
The qnm calculator is written in the radial fixing gauge, but parameters for cauchy gauge are provied too as comments at the end.
